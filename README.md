### §1 — Summary <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

I'm a builder in the Cosmos Ecosystem and one of the lead engineers for a new DeFi hub named [Nibiru](https://github.com/NibiruChain). I like making things, whether it's artwork, music, or software applications. Creating things makes me happy. 
 
### §2 — Some open-source projects

| Repository | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 🐍 [python-crypto-api-wrappers] | A Python package for wrapping common Crypto APIs like Messari, Coin Market Cap, Etherscan, etc. |
| 📝 [Commonplace book](https://unique-divine.gitbook.io/commonplace-book/introduction/readme) |  Notes, tutorials, and reference materials for Python, Golang and the Cosmos SDK, Typescript, React, Artificial Intelligence, and effective learning. |
| 💻 [RL_Memory][rl-memory] | A research project in vision-based, deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve sample efficiency using transfer learning, unsupervised representation learning, and attention mechanisms to interpret memories. |
| 🧬 [GANs-for-Genomics][genomics-gans-code] | Computational genomics research where I leveraged deep learning to generate and learn from synthetic DNA samples. |
| 🏫 [Langevin-Dynamics-for-NN-Optimization][langevin-repo] | Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) implementations based on Langevin Dynamics and tested on real-world data |
| <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Typescript_logo_2020.svg" height=18> [NibiruChain/sdk-ts](https://github.com/NibiruChain/sdk-ts/) | TypeScript-based client SDK for interacting with the Nibiru blockchain |

### §3 — Other interests 

- 🎼 Music: I try not to go a day without practicing 🎷 or 🎹.
- 📊 Algorithmic trading
- 📚 Reading: Some time in 2021, I decided to read and take notes on roughly two books a month. [[reading list]][reading-list]
- 🧠 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/): I'm a huge nerd about spaced repetition software. I've been using Anki to learn faster and remember more of what I learn for 5+ years at this point. Although I have over 100,000 mature cards, the reviews take up less than 10 minutes a day when I stop adding new material. Using Anki effectively was a crucial element in my journey to [learn Japanese to fluency](https://uniquedivine.blog/post/japanese/why_learn_jp_again/). 

"And if there is no God  
I'll know the day I die I lived through heaven  
And that I gave it hell  
And if it hurt, oh well  
At least that's living..." - [Eden](https://youtu.be/geZ_5Ri7ANg).
