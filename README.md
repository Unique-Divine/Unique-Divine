### What I'm currently focused on: 

#### §1. Active projects

- 🍷 Software development and data science work for the [Sommelier Protocol](https://sommelier.finance/), a multi-chain (Ethereum and Cosmos) automated investment platform. 
- 📊 Algorithmic stock and cryptocurrency trading.
 
#### §2. Open-source side projects

- 🐍 A Python package for wrapping common Crypto APIs like Messari, Coin Market Cap, Etherscan, etc.
- 💻 A research project in vision-based, deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve sample efficiency using transfer learning, unsupervised representation learning, and attention mechanisms to interpret memories. [[code]][rl-memory]
- 🧬 Computational genomics research | I leverage deep learning to generate and learn from synthetic DNA samples. [[code]][genomics-gans-code]
- 📝 Writing self-contained tutorials for data structures and algorithms in Python. [[doc]][commonplace-code.md] 

#### §3. Other interests

- 🎼 Music: I try not to go a day without practicing 🎷, 🎹, or 🎸.
- 🏫 Bayesian Neural Networks: [[Experiment with Langevin-Dynamics based Stochastic Gradient Descent]][langevin-repo].
- 📚 Reading: Some time in 2021, I decided to read and take notes on a minimum of two books per month. [[current progress]][reading-list]

"And if there is no God  
I'll know the day I die I lived through heaven  
And that I gave it hell  
And if it hurt, oh well  
At least that's living..." - [Eden](https://youtu.be/geZ_5Ri7ANg).
