### What I'm currently focused on: 

#### §1. Work
- 📊 Data science @ IBM

#### §2. Side projects
- 💻 A research project in vision-based, deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve sample efficiency using transfer learning, unsupervised representation learning, and attention mechanisms to interpret memories. [[code]][rl-memory]
- 🧬 Computational genomics research | I leverage deep learning to generate and learn from synthetic DNA samples. [[code]][genomics-gans-code]
- 🤖 Artificial intelligence and DevOps work on healthcare applications @ Applied Technology Solutions, Inc. ([ApTSi])
- 💰 Leading and collaborating with an algorithmic trading team 👯

#### §3. Other interests

I try not to go a day without practicing 🎷, 🎹, or 🎸
- 📚 Earlier this year, I decided to read and take notes on a minimum of two books per month. [[current progress]][reading-list]
- 🏫 I finished graduate school at Columbia University last month. Here's a [recent project][langevin-repo].

"And if there is no God  
I'll know the day I die I lived through heaven  
And that I gave it hell  
And if it hurt, oh well  
At least that's living..." - [Eden](https://youtu.be/geZ_5Ri7ANg).
