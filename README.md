### §1: Summary <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

I'm a programmer that makes music and writes. I live to with learn, solve problems, and create, whether this involves music, artwork, or coding. For work, I build [Nibiru](https://nibiru.fi), a breakthrough smart contract ecosystem in the blockchain space.
 
### §2: Active Open-source Projects

| Repository | Description | 
| ---- | --- |
| <img src="https://uniquedivine.blog/hero/nibiru-icon.png" height=18> [NibiruChain/nibiru](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru) | Nibiru source code. Nibiru is a breakthrough smart contract platform powering an ecosystem of decentralized applications. |
| ⚡ [Unique-Divine/jiyuu](https://github.com/Unique-Divine/jiyuu) | CLI utilities monorepo solving concrete dev problems: Go coverage merging (gocovmerge), Windows↔Linux encoding fixes (winfixtext), language-agnostic dev commands across Go/Rust/TS (mycli), Markdown TOC generation (mdtoc), and LLM context parsing (aictx). Built primarily in Go with TypeScript components. |
| <img src="https://uniquedivine.blog/hero/nibiru-icon.png" style="width:18px;height:18px;display:inline"> [NibiruChain/nibiru-wasm](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru-wasm) | Rust monorepo and smart contract prototyping hub for Nibiru. Includes dev tooling, production and example smart contracts, an end-to-end testing framework, and other useful libraries. |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unique-Divine/Unique-Divine/master/img/neovim-mark.svg" height=18> [Unique-Divine/dotfiles](https://github.com/Unique-Divine/dotfiles/) | Dotfiles, config for nvim, tmux, zsh, a nice bash library for scripts, and a reproducible build configuration for my machine. |
| <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Typescript_logo_2020.svg" height=18> [NibiruChain/ts-sdk](https://github.com/NibiruChain/ts-sdk/) | A TypeScript-based client SDK for interacting with the Nibiru blockchain. Published as [@nibiruchain/nibijs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nibiruchain/nibijs) on npm. |
| 📝 [Commonplace book][commonplace-book] |  Notes, tutorials, and reference materials for Python, Golang and the Cosmos SDK, Typescript, React, Artificial Intelligence, and effective learning. |

### §3: Other Passions and Interests

- 🎼 Music: I practice the 🎷 and 🎹.
- 🧠 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/): I'm a huge nerd about spaced repetition software and other strategies for accelerated learning. I've been using Anki to learn faster and remember more of what I learn for probably 5+ years at this point. Although I have over 100,000 mature cards, the reviews take up less than 10 minutes a day when I stop adding new material. Using Anki effectively was a crucial element in my journey to [learn Japanese to fluency](https://uniquedivine.blog/post/japanese/why_learn_jp_again/).

> "And if there is no God
I'll know the day I die I lived through heaven
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living..." - [Eden](https://youtu.be/geZ_5Ri7ANg).

### §4: Legacy Projects

| Repository | Description | Status | 
| ---- | --- | --- | 
| 💻 [grid-world-plus][rl-memory] | A research project in vision-based, deep reinforcement learning. The goal of this project was to improve sample efficiency to interpret memories using transfer learning, unsupervised representation learning, and attention mechanisms. | ✅ Completed, 2021 |
| <img src="https://www.assemblyscript.org/images/icon.svg" style="width:18px; margin: 0; display:inline;"> [cellar-subgraphs](https://github.com/PeggyJV/cellar-subgraphs/) | Subgraphs to process and store entities for blockchain events emitted from the Sommelier Cellar contracts. Built using The Graph's AssemblyScript library, `graph-ts`.  | ✅ Completed, 2022 |
| 🧬 [GANs-for-Genomics][genomics-gans-code] | Computational genomics research where I leveraged deep learning to generate and learn from synthetic DNA samples. | ✅ Completed, 2021 |
| 🏫 [Langevin-Dynamics-for-NN-Optimization][langevin-repo] | Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) implementations based on Langevin Dynamics and tested on real-world data | ✅ Completed, 2021 |
